Belt Badgers is designed as either a support to academic pursuits in a school situation, or as a way to track 
progress in a self-directed educational curriculum. At it's core it manages projects, administers tests, tracks
progress and awards achievements.

The initial vision for this came out of the idea of using Kerbal Space Program as an educational environment. But
I wanted to be able to setup a track of activities that would lead to ever more ambitious goals. In this case,
Belt Badgers would look like:

1. A discipline is created by a student (everyone is a student)
2. The discipline contains an overview, reference links, books, reading material
3. Badges are created inside a discipline that can be collected by completing certain projects
4. Once a project is completed, a student can take a test which shows that a student has finished the work
5. Students are awarded a badge for completing each test
6. Student progress can be shared, either publiclly, or privately with other students

The focus of the app is on the disciplines. The hope is that there are a handful of these bundled with the app,
around the area of technology and science. But any user could create and curate a new discipline and then 
either keep it private to share with specific students, or open it up publicly for anyone to work their way
through.
